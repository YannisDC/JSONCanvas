SwiftJSONCanvas: Swift Implementation of the JSONCanvas Spec

SwiftJSONCanvas is a robust Swift package that implements the JSONCanvas specification (jsoncanvas.org), providing a powerful toolkit for infinite canvas experiences across Apple platforms. This package brings the open file format for infinite canvas data to the Swift ecosystem, enabling developers to create, manipulate, and store spatial information with ease.

Key Features:
• Full JSONCanvas Spec Implementation: Adheres to the open file format defined at jsoncanvas.org
• Cross-platform Support: Works seamlessly on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS
• Infinite Canvas Capabilities: Enables spatial organization of information, like a digital whiteboard
• JSON-based Storage: Uses the .canvas extension for easy file management and interoperability
• SwiftUI Integration: Built with SwiftUI for modern, declarative UI development

Why SwiftJSONCanvas?
1. Longevity: Ensures your canvas data remains accessible and usable long-term
2. Readability: Utilizes human-readable JSON format for easy inspection and editing
3. Interoperability: Facilitates data exchange between different infinite canvas apps
4. Extensibility: Allows for future enhancements while maintaining backwards compatibility
5. Data Ownership: Gives users full control over their infinite canvas data

Ideal for Developing:
- Digital whiteboard applications
- Mind mapping and brainstorming tools
- Visual note-taking apps
- Collaborative planning platforms
- Spatial information organizers

SwiftJSONCanvas empowers developers to create infinite canvas tools that encourage freedom and exploration. By implementing the JSONCanvas spec, it provides a standardized way to store and manipulate infinite canvas data in Swift applications.

Whether you're building the next revolutionary note-taking app or a collaborative whiteboard tool, SwiftJSONCanvas offers the foundation you need to work with infinite canvas data efficiently and effectively.
